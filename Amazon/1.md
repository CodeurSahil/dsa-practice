The Manager of Amazon Warehouse need to Ship n Product from Different Locations, the location of i th product is represented by an array location[i].

The Manager is allowded to perform one operation at a time

Operation are:
1. If the Inventory has two or more products, the manager can pick two product from inventory, if they have different locations i.e. locations[x] != locations[y] and ship both of them
2. If the Inventory has one or more products, the manager can pick one product x from the inventory and ship it.

Note: After Shipping a product it get removed from the inventory, and the rest of products which are currently not shipped come together keeping the order same a before

Given n products and an array locations, find the minimum number of operations that the manager has to perform to ship all products

Given n=5 and locations=[1,8,6,7,7]

### **Given:**

* `n = 5`
* `locations = [1, 8, 6, 7, 7]`

Each product is at a location denoted by `locations[i]`.
The manager wants to **ship all products** using the **minimum number of operations**.

---

### **Operations Available:**

1. **Two-product Operation**:
   If there are **at least 2 products** in inventory and **they come from different locations**, the manager can **ship them together** in one operation.
   That is:

   * Pick two items `x` and `y`
   * If `locations[x] != locations[y]`, ship both

2. **Single-product Operation**:
   Pick one item and ship it. (Use this when you can't pair it with another item of a different location)

---

### **Goal:**

Use the fewest possible number of operations to ship all `n` products.

## 🔍 Understanding With Example

```js
n = 5
locations = [1, 8, 6, 7, 7]
```

* We need to group products **from different locations** to **ship 2 at a time**.
* If we can’t find a different-location pair, we must ship 1 alone.

Let’s count how many products we have from each location:

```js
location counts:
1 -> 1 product
8 -> 1 product
6 -> 1 product
7 -> 2 products
```

---

### ✅ Strategy:

To minimize operations:

* **Pair as many different-location products as possible**
* If odd one is left with no possible pairing, use single-product operation

Let’s try pairing:

1. Pair (1, 8) → different → 1 operation
2. Pair (6, 7) → different → 1 operation
3. Leftover: 1 product with location 7 → ship it alone → 1 operation

---

### ✅ Total Operations: **3**

So the answer for `locations = [1, 8, 6, 7, 7]` is **3 operations**.

---

## 🧠 Intuition Summary:

To minimize operations:

* **Pair products from different locations**
* Every pair removes 2 items
* Remaining items that can't be paired must be shipped individually

---

### 🚀 General Idea for Algorithm:

1. Count frequency of each location
2. Try to match different locations in pairs
3. Keep pairing until fewer than 2 different locations remain
4. Ship remaining as single items

Let me know if you’d like a code solution or to try a few more examples!




```
function minOperations(locations) {
  const freqMap = new Map();

  // Step 1: Count frequency of each location
  for (let loc of locations) {
    freqMap.set(loc, (freqMap.get(loc) || 0) + 1);
  }

  // Step 2: Create a max heap using a simple array (we'll sort it each time)
  const heap = [...freqMap.values()];

  let operations = 0;

  while (heap.length >= 2) {
    // Sort heap descending to get two largest elements
    heap.sort((a, b) => b - a);

    const first = heap.shift();  // Most frequent
    const second = heap.shift(); // Second most frequent

    operations++; // Perform a 2-product operation

    // Decrease their frequencies and push back if still > 0
    if (first - 1 > 0) heap.push(first - 1);
    if (second - 1 > 0) heap.push(second - 1);
  }

  // Step 3: Handle remaining items (ship one by one)
  if (heap.length === 1) operations += heap[0];

  return operations;
}
```
