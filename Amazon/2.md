There are m cities in a 1 D Country, where each city is represented by an integer between 1 through m.

There are n Amazon Warehouses, where the i th warehouse can deviver to cities in the range
cityStart[i] to cityEnd[i] for better delivary management.

For example, if there are 
m = 10 cities &
n = 2 warehouses
cityStart = [3, 1]
cityEnd = [10, 5]
then the first warehouse delivers to cities from 3 to 10 and 
the Second warehouse delivers to cities from 1 to 5
thus the cities 3,4,5 are served by 2 warehouse
and other by 1

Define f(x) as the number of warehouses that can delivar to x th city
The Growth coefficent is F(1)^F(2)...F(m-1)^F(m),
where ^ is the BITWISE Operator

Given the delivery ranges of all the Amazon warehouses, find Amazon's growth coefficient.

Note: The bitwise XOR operator (^) returns a 1 in each bits position for which the corresponding bits of either but not both operands are 1s.
12 = 00001100 (In Binary)
25 = 00011001 (In Binary)
Bitwise XOR Operation of 12 and 25
1100 ^ 11001 = 10101 = 21 (In decimal)

### üèôÔ∏è **Problem Summary**

You are given:

* `m`: total number of **cities** (labeled from 1 to m)
* `n`: number of **warehouses**
* Two arrays:

  * `cityStart[i]`: starting city index that warehouse `i` delivers to
  * `cityEnd[i]`: ending city index that warehouse `i` delivers to

Each warehouse can deliver to all cities in its `[start, end]` range.

---

### ‚úÖ **Objective**

For each city `x` (from 1 to `m`), compute `f(x)` = **number of warehouses that deliver to city `x`**.

Then compute:

```
Growth Coefficient = f(1) ^ f(2) ^ f(3) ^ ... ^ f(m)
```

Where `^` is the **bitwise XOR** operator.

### üß† Let's Take Your Example:

```js
m = 10
n = 2
cityStart = [3, 1]
cityEnd   = [10, 5]
```

This means:

* Warehouse 1: delivers to cities 3 to 10
* Warehouse 2: delivers to cities 1 to 5

Let‚Äôs calculate f(x) for each city from 1 to 10:

| City (x) | Warehouses Delivering | f(x) |
| -------- | --------------------- | ---- |
| 1        | \[Warehouse 2]        | 1    |
| 2        | \[Warehouse 2]        | 1    |
| 3        | \[Warehouse 1, 2]     | 2    |
| 4        | \[Warehouse 1, 2]     | 2    |
| 5        | \[Warehouse 1, 2]     | 2    |
| 6        | \[Warehouse 1]        | 1    |
| 7        | \[Warehouse 1]        | 1    |
| 8        | \[Warehouse 1]        | 1    |
| 9        | \[Warehouse 1]        | 1    |
| 10       | \[Warehouse 1]        | 1    |

So the `f(x)` values are:
`[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

Now compute the XOR of all those values:

```js
1 ^ 1 = 0
0 ^ 2 = 2
2 ^ 2 = 0
0 ^ 2 = 2
2 ^ 1 = 3
3 ^ 1 = 2
2 ^ 1 = 3
3 ^ 1 = 2
2 ^ 1 = 3
```

‚úÖ Final result: **3**

---

### ‚úÖ So, the Growth Coefficient = **3**

---

### üìå Summary of the Steps:

1. Create an array `f[1..m]` initialized with 0s.
2. For each warehouse, increment `f[x]` for all cities `x` in its `[cityStart[i], cityEnd[i]]` range.
3. Compute the XOR of all values in `f`.

## ‚úÖ JavaScript Version

```javascript
function growthCoefficient(m, cityStart, cityEnd) {
  const f = new Array(m).fill(0); // f[0] to f[m-1] for cities 1 to m

  for (let i = 0; i < cityStart.length; i++) {
    const start = cityStart[i] - 1; // convert to 0-indexed
    const end = cityEnd[i] - 1;
    for (let j = start; j <= end; j++) {
      f[j]++;
    }
  }

  let result = 0;
  for (let count of f) {
    result ^= count; // XOR operation
  }

  return result;
}

// Example usage
const m = 10;
const cityStart = [3, 1];
const cityEnd = [10, 5];
console.log(growthCoefficient(m, cityStart, cityEnd)); // Output: 3
```

---

## ‚úÖ Python Version

```python
def growth_coefficient(m, cityStart, cityEnd):
    f = [0] * m  # f[0] to f[m-1] for cities 1 to m

    for start, end in zip(cityStart, cityEnd):
        for i in range(start - 1, end):  # Convert to 0-indexed
            f[i] += 1

    result = 0
    for count in f:
        result ^= count  # XOR operation

    return result

# Example usage
m = 10
cityStart = [3, 1]
cityEnd = [10, 5]
print(growth_coefficient(m, cityStart, cityEnd))  # Output: 3
```

### ‚úÖ Optimizations (for large inputs)

For very large `m`, we can optimize using a **prefix sum technique** with a difference array (let me know if you want that too).

But for small to medium sizes (say up to 1e4), the above solution works perfectly.

Let me know if you want the optimized version too or want to test with more inputs!
