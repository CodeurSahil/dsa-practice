Your current solution works and is clear‚Äîyou're recursively simulating the rotting process minute-by-minute, tracking rotten oranges in each cycle. However, a more **efficient** and **standard approach** for this type of problem is to use **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, which is ideal for problems involving spreading over a grid in steps.

### ‚úÖ **Why BFS is better**:

* Avoids deep recursion, so it's **safer for larger input sizes** (recursion may hit call stack limits).
* Straightforward to manage levels (i.e., minutes passed) in BFS.
* More **readable** and **concise** using a queue.

### üîÅ BFS-Based Solution (JavaScript):

```js
var orangesRotting = function(grid) {
    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;
    const queue = [];
    let freshCount = 0;

    // Step 1: Find all initial rotten oranges and count fresh oranges
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            if (grid[r][c] === 2) {
                queue.push([r, c]);
            } else if (grid[r][c] === 1) {
                freshCount++;
            }
        }
    }

    if (freshCount === 0) return 0; // No fresh oranges to rot

    let minutes = 0;
    const directions = [[1,0], [-1,0], [0,1], [0,-1]];

    // Step 2: BFS from initially rotten oranges
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const size = queue.length;
        let rotted = false;

        for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            const [x, y] = queue.shift();

            for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
                const nx = x + dx;
                const ny = y + dy;

                if (
                    nx >= 0 && nx < rows &&
                    ny >= 0 && ny < cols &&
                    grid[nx][ny] === 1
                ) {
                    grid[nx][ny] = 2; // Rot the fresh orange
                    queue.push([nx, ny]);
                    freshCount--;
                    rotted = true;
                }
            }
        }

        if (rotted) minutes++;
    }

    return freshCount === 0 ? minutes : -1;
};
```

### üü¢ Benefits of This Version:

* **Time Complexity**: O(m √ó n) ‚Äì each cell is visited once.
* **Space Complexity**: O(m √ó n) ‚Äì in the worst case, the queue may hold all the cells.
* Avoids deep recursion.
* Easier to debug and reason about time progression (each BFS level is 1 minute).

### üîç Summary

Your recursive solution is correct but may be **inefficient** or **unsafe for larger grids** due to stack depth limits. The BFS approach is the standard and more robust solution for this class of problems.

Let me know if you want a version using `Set` or `Map` instead of the queue array or prefer a recursive version with optimizations.
